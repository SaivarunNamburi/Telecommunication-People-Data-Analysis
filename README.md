# Telecommunication Data Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to model the probability of employee attrition for a large telecommunications company. The goal is to identify the key factors contributing to high attrition rates and provide actionable recommendations to senior management to help reduce these rates and improve employee retention.

## Project Overview
Employee attrition can lead to significant challenges such as project delays, increased recruitment costs, and reduced productivity. By analyzing various employee-related factors, this project aims to:
- Identify the most significant predictors of employee attrition.
- Provide insights and recommendations to mitigate the identified factors.
- Improve the company's overall retention strategy.

## Instructions to Run the Jupyter Notebook

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 installed on your computer.
- Jupyter Notebook or VSCode installed.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SaivarunNamburi/Telecommunication-People-Data-Analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Telecommunication-People-Data-Analysis
    ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
    You need to install the required Python libraries. Open your terminal and run:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    - If you are using Jupyter Notebook, run:
      ```sh
      jupyter notebook
      ```
      Then, open the `Telecommunication_People_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file.
      
    - If you are using VSCode, open the project folder in VSCode and open the `Telecommunication_People_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file.

5. **Run the Notebook**:
    Once the notebook is open, run all the cells to execute the analysis. You can do this by selecting `Run All` from the `Cell` menu in Jupyter Notebook or by clicking the `Run All` button in VSCode.

## Key Insights
- **Total Working Years**: Employees with fewer total working years are more likely to leave the company.
- **Years With Current Manager**: Employees who have been with their current manager for a shorter duration tend to leave more frequently.
- **Business Travel**: Frequent business travel is associated with higher attrition rates.
- **Marital Status**: Single employees have a higher likelihood of leaving the company.
- **Years Since Last Promotion**: Employees who have not been promoted for a long time are more likely to leave.

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Career Development Programs**: Focus on providing clear career progression paths and regular promotions to reduce dissatisfaction among employees.
2. **Improve Manager-Employee Relationships**: Encourage managers to build stronger relationships with their teams to increase employee retention.
3. **Review Travel Policies**: Consider the impact of frequent business travel on employee well-being and explore options to minimize unnecessary travel.
4. **Support Work-Life Balance**: Implement policies and programs that support a better work-life balance to retain employees, especially those who are single and may have fewer personal commitments.

## Recommendations for Data Collection/Analysis Process

### Data Collection
1. **Automate Data Collection**: Implement automated data collection methods to reduce errors and ensure real-time data availability.
2. **Integrate Systems**: Ensure all data systems are integrated, allowing for seamless data flow and reducing the need for manual data consolidation.
3. **Standardize Data Entry**: Establish standardized data entry protocols to maintain consistency and accuracy across datasets.

### Data Analysis
1. **Regularly Update Models**: Frequently update predictive models with new data to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.
2. **Conduct Regular Training**: Ensure that data analysts and other relevant staff receive regular training on the latest data analysis methodologies and tools.
3. **Implement Data Quality Checks**: Regularly perform data quality checks to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or errors in the data.


## Conclusion
By understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition, the telecommunications company can implement targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention. Regularly monitoring these factors and updating policies accordingly will help in maintaining a stable and motivated workforce.
